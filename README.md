# YT-UI

This repository was created with the idea of ​​practicing react.js and tailwind CSS.
It is intended to recreate the youtube UI with no API connections yet.
Let's have fun!

> Reminder: when cloning the repo, always run the `npm install` command.
> To start the app: `npm run start`

## Workflow
I inspected the YT page and separated the relevant sections into Trello tickets.
I am going to create separate branches for each ticket, to work more organized.
Once the work is complete, I will send PR to the main branch to do the merge.
